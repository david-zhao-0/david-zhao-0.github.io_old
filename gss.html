                Tienson-Tseng. This will be the place where I upload my slides and worksheets for my GSS sessions. I
                will

                    powerpoint. I
                    recall that during the session a student had asked whether histidine would be protonated at a pH of
                    7.4, to which I (incorrectly) said that it would be protonated. <b>This is wrong.</b> Just running
                    through the <a href="GSSMaterials/histidinecorrection.jpg">calculations</a>, given that histidine's
                    R group pKa is 6, we see that the physiological pH
                    of 7.4 would result in histidine being found in the deprotonated form nearly 25 times more than the
                    protonated form. Thus, both N' - HAWAII - C' and N' - MICHIGAN - C' should have a net charge of
                    <b>0</b> at physiological pH. Sorry for any confusion caused by this.

                <p id="Overflow">The student-made amino acid sequence N' - GAWIQVLNH - C' is a good example of side
                    chain interactions between n and n+3, n+4 groups. The glycine at the first residue for instance
                    could interact with the isoleucine at the fourth residue through induced dipole-induced dipole
                    interactions. Similarly, the glutamine residue at residue number 5 can interact with the asparagine
                    residue at residue 8 through hydrogen bonding interactions.<br><br>
                    I have also made a correction in the chart of interacting amino acid side chains. After doing some
                    searching it seems that tryptophan mainly participates in nonpolar interactions, whereas hydrogen
                    bonding plays a minor role. For the purposes of this class, we will categorize tryptophan as just a
                    nonpolar interactor.</p>

                <p id="Overflow">Thermodynamics is a topic which students tend to have a difficult time understanding in
                    this course. My advice for dealing with questions of thermodynamics? Understand the
                    <i>components</i> you
                    are working with. At least in biochemistry, we are primarily concerned with whether a system forms
                    or breaks bonds (change in dH) or whether entropy is increased or decreased with a process (change
                    in dS).
                    In biological systems, the temperature hardly ever changes, so when considering the free energy
                    change
                    of a reaction, enthalpy and entropy changes are the ones which matter. Always ask: is this process
                    forming or breaking bonds? Will there be an increase or a decrease in the entropy of the system
                    following this process? Understanding these relationships will be key to helping you understand
                    thermodynamics.
