                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p id="Overflow">I love playing and listening to music. Currently, I can play the piano and the electric
                    guitar, having played each for around 15 and 4 years, respectively (though admittedly I haven't been
                    keeping up with piano as much since guitar sounds cooler to me... lol). At a young age I actually
                    did
                    not like music that much ⁠— in my naivete, it seemed like some useless skill that my parents kept
                    telling
                    me to stick with even though I didn't really care (sorry mom and dad). Eventually though, I came to
                    realize how right they were. I listened to classical pieces while I studied, and obscure rock
                    groups some hipster friends introduced to me while commuting to and from school (<a

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p id="Overflow"><i>Full Disclosure: I am not at all an expert at programming. In fact, this whole
                        website
                        is an experiment for me to practice my HTML and CSS skills.</i> However, over the course
                    of my college career, I've become convinced that as a researcher, <b>being able to program is an
                        invaluable tool</b>. Sitting down and learning to code, learning a few tricks in Python, Java or
                    even HTML
                    and CSS ⁠— whatever language you want ⁠— can save a ton of time doing menial computer tasks in the
                    future. You absolutely won't regret it, I promise!<br><br>A good example of how programming saved me
                    valuable time was when I was still working on metabolic research at UMD. In June of 2021, I
                    frequently worked
                    with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analytical methods, specifically, with the bundled
                    Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis software which exports data of intermediary metabolites.
                    OK, so if you've never heard of that before, you may be thinking to yourself, what the heck is he
                    talking
                    about? Essentially, the software for our GC-MS machine spit out an ocean of data across dozens of
                    metabolites from our study, each with two or more isotopes to track and dozens of samples of
                    different groups to yield thousands of mass spectrometer peaks. Organizing these spreadsheets into a
                    readable
                    form through Excel was a tedious and error-prone hell which often took over an hour or two to
                    complete.
                    However, after noticing patterns in the organization of the data and realizing that I had some
                    background in Java, I developed a simple program over my spring break to organize the raw data into
                    a readable form. After a few days of work on my project (and almost losing all of my progess - "git
                    reset -hard" is a <i>dangerous</i> command), what was a laborious and fault-prone hour or two hour
                    long
                    process was quickly reduced to mere seconds of work.<br><br>Since then, I have found creative ways
                    to apply programming to all sorts of tasks in research, such as developing a script to organize raw
                    RT-PCR data and analyze it using the Livak method to yield gene expression levels, or a program
                    which tracks specific indices of amino acid sequences and returns the corresponding codon sequeunce
                    for
                    that residue to design mutant proteins.<br><br>I think the best part about integrating
                    programming
                    into one's research is the respect you earn from your colleagues. Especially in the fields of
                    biotechnology and clinical research, skills in computer science are <i>highly</i> sought
                    after. While being a computer scientist at
                    a big tech company is common, having programming skills in other disciplines will surely make you
                    stand out as an asset. I recall after I completed the RT-PCR and GC-MS programs for analyzing huge
                    data sets, many
                    of my colleagues that had worked with the data by hand before I developed the program expressed
                    their appreciation for saving valuable time by automating the
                    tedious task. For many of them, the process was almost magical. People's reaction to my hidden skill
                    is part of the reason why I like programming, not only as a research tool, but as a hobby.

                <h3>Cooking</h3>
                <p id="Overflow">To be honest, cooking seems to be more like a necessary skill to have rather than a
                    hobby. But, it's something which I enjoy a lot, and as such, I have included it in my list of
                    hobbies. In many ways, it's like conducting an experiment - you follow a recipe (the protocol) to
                    produce delicious yummy food (ok maybe not quite like an experiment). Though I primarily cook
                    Chinese food, I am not afraid to explore cuisines of different cultures. <br><br><b>Here are some examples of
                    the dishes I cook </b>:</p>

                <h3>Language Acquisition</h3>
                <p id="Overflow">Why is learning a language important? Well, in my experience, one of the most
                    challenging adversities barring immigrants from social
                    mobility is the language barrier. When my parents initially immigrated to the United States from
                    China, work was scarce as many employers in rural Minnesota did not want to hire non-native English
                    speakers. The silent discrimination our family faced forced us to constantly move across state lines
                    in search of work, and my parents often felt alienated from American society, believing that they
                    did
                    not belong in this country.
                    The linguistic prejudice my family endured is the primary reason why I developed an interest in
                    language learning. I wanted to assure that no one, immigrant or otherwise, would feel excluded by a
                    narrow-minded few. Seeking to uphold my principles and test my communication skills, I committed
                    myself to
                    community involvement.
                    Though it has been a while, the summer of my sophomore year in high school I volunteered as an
                    interpreter for the
                    International Offices at Montgomery County Public Schools. Facilitating the vaccination process for
                    newly immigrated families, I gave directions and provided information in Chinese and French. The
                    experience was transformative, especially as someone who empathized with the adversities immigrant
                    families faced. Offering guidance was more than just a means of breaking down the language barrier.
                    In retrospect, my more profound goal was to communicate that sense of belongingness which was absent
                    in my immigration journey. All languages are beautiful in their own way.<br><br>Though I was born in
                    the US, English was technically not my first language. Soon after I was born, I lived in China with
                    my mother and grandparents for around 2 years. My first word was actually a Chinese word, 灯
                    (deng(1)), meaning light! As was common in many traditional Chinese households, I memorized ancient
                    Chinese poems (唐诗 tang(2) shi(1)) during my time in China (some of which I still remember today),
                    and
                    became proficient in Chinese before I even knew basic English. Early in high school, I learned Latin
                    in
                    class, which I used to develop skills in two romance languages, French and Spanish. I
                    actually became conversational in French at a point (after around 3 months of
                    self-studying), but eventually forgot much of it as school began to get busier and I had less time
                    to practice. Sometime around my high school years I also picked up the ability to read Cyrillic and
                    Hangul, though I have not properly learned Russian and Korean themselves. Around my senior year of
                    high school I also began to pick up Japanese, since my father had learned it before and because I
                    found the culture of Japan to be interesting. Additionally, the challenge of learning a
                    language as hard as Japanese was also part of the appeal to me (call me a masochist). As of 2022 I
                    am conversational in Japanese, and am able to read, write, and speak at a basic level.
