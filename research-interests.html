            <h2>My Research Interests</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p id="Overflow">Currently, my research interests are broad. My first experience with research was in the <a
                    href="https://nsunnylab.com/">lab of Dr.
                    Nishanth Sunny</a> in the Department of Animal and Avian Sciences at the University of Maryland,
                College Park. There, I analyzed the impacts of Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) on mitochondrial
                dysfunction, igniting a profound interest in research within me.
                Since then, I have broadened my research experiences to include stem cell biology and gene therapy
                technologies at 
                <!-- both  -->
                <a href="https://www.ibex.bio/home">Ibex Biosciences</a>
                <!-- and <a
                    href="https://www.usmedigene.com/">US Medigene</a> 
                    two 
                    biotechnology companies headquartered in -->
                <!-- Rockville, Maryland, -->
                 and seek to expand even further!</p>
            <h3>Metabolic Biochemistry</h3>

            <p id="Overflow">I was fortunate to have hands-on experience learning about intermediary metabolism through
                research as I was taking Biochemistry of Metabolism (BCHM 462) at UMD. The class itself was already
                very interesting to me, covering topics ranging from the mechanisms of the citric acid cycle to
                the pentose phosphate pathway, ketogenesis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and polyketide synthases.
                However, with my firsthand experience in the lab of Dr. Sunny I was able to augment onto my established
                knowledge in class by creatively applying my understanding of metabolism to trace 13C labeled citric
                acid and ketogenic metabolites for our experimental model. With my existing understanding of metabolism
                and endocrinology, I worked alongside graduate students to interpret how isotopically labeled carbon
                intermediates were incorporated into the TCA cycle and the ketogenesis pathway through gas
                chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. The results of our findings have resulted in the publishing of
                several papers, of which I am a co-author of one. The paper
                (in the process of being published), titled "Branched Chain Amino Acids Alter Cellular Redox to Induce
                Lipid Oxidation and Reduce De Novo Lipogenesis in the Liver" discusses the impacts of a diet high in
                Branched Chain Amino Acids in the generation of Adipocytes and the breakdown of Lipids. My interest in
                metabolism and its endocrine regulators have directly resulted in me securing a position as a Guided
                Study Session (GSS) leader at UMD for the Biochemistry of Physiology (BCHM463). I look forward to
                teaching topics in metabolism and physiology to new students!</p>
            <h3>Gene and Stem Cell Therapy</h3>
            <p id="Overflow">While working as an undergraduate researcher at UMD, I reached out to local biotechnology
                companies in my area to experience research outside academia and in the industry. I ended up working at
                <!-- two companies,  -->
                <a href="https://www.ibex.bio/">Ibex Biosciences</a>.
                <!-- and <a
                    href="https://www.usmedigene.com/">US Medigene.</a>  -->
                    While working at Ibex Biosciences as a Research
                Associate, I became interested in a project which involved manipulating cell signaling pathways,
                specifically involved in the inflammatory response, to analyze competitive or synergistic roles of two
                cell signaling pathways in inflammation. Two other projects I became involved in at my time there
                involved improving stem cell therapy to become more clinically applicable through the exploration of
                transcription factors other than the Yamanaka factors to induce pluripotency (as the Yamanaka factors
                contain oncogenic or metastasis-inducing genes such as c-Myc and KLF4), and the induction of
                pluripotency from astrocytes to neuronal progenitor cells for the differentiation of astrocytes to
                neurons. Though everyone's research experiences may be different, I personally found that research in
                industry was much more
                relaxed than research in academia. Though there is a competitive edge in securing funding for new
                studies, there was not much motivation for companies to publish papers and make
                new discoveries. Instead, companies primarily sought to validate existing scientific discoveries and to
                license their products through patents.</p>
            <h3>Biophysics of Mechanosensitive Ion Channels</h3>
            <p id="Overflow">In the Fall Semester of 2023, I will be exploring a completely new area of research under
                Dr. Sergei Sukharev at the Institute for Physical Science and Technology (IPST) at UMD. Admittedly,
                venturing into this completely new field from my research background is daunting, but I hope to gain
                additional
                experience in academia that would prove valuable to me for pursuing a doctoral degree in the future. I'm
                open to experiencing a broad range of research such that I can declare with confidence what area I would
                like to focus on in pursuing my Ph.D. <br><br>I have read literature regarding Dr. Sukharev's research
                already,
                but I will update this page with more information as my research progresses!</p>
            <h3>Antibody-Conjugated Glycoengineering</h3>
            <p id="Overflow">In addition to the research at IPST, I will also receive training in LC-MS and HPLC
                methodologies as a Research Associate at <a href="https://glycot.com/">GlycoT Therapeutics</a> in
                the Fall Semester. Again, I believe in experiencing many fields of research so that I can be more
                confident with pursuing a Ph.D. topic. This industry research experience seems to be more heavily
                focused on
                chemistry than research I have been previously involved in. In particular, GlycoT's research entails
                chemoenzymatic synthesis
                of antibody-linked sugars for greater site-specific targeting capabilities of antibodies.</p>
            <h3>Endocrinology of Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGFs)</h3>
            <p id="Overflow">In the summer of 2023, I am going to the University of Tokyo in Japan to participate in a
                fully-funded, independent research project under the competitive AMGEN Scholars Program to conduct
                research in the molecular mechanisms of IGFs under various physiological conditions. Though the host lab
                (the lab of <a href="http://webpark1586.sakura.ne.jp/OldWebPage/shingroup/English/index.html">Dr.
                    Shin-ichiro Takahashi</a>) covers a vast range of topics, the project I am most interested in
                participating in (given my long history with an endocrine condition and my previous experience in
                metabolic research) are his projects on amino acid catabolism in relation to IGFs and the development of
                physiology and disease.</p>
